HttpClient
==========
HttpClient is a client class for the HTTP protocol. It can be used to interact with another web server from within a PHP script. As well as retrieving information from a server, HttpClient can interact with a server via POST or GET. It can therefore be used as part of any script that needs to communicate with an application running on another site.
